# This is an docker-compose overlay that uses unison for syncing files between the host
# and containers.  On OS X it is much faster than simple mounting of local files
# You need to run docker/dev/start-unison.sh to start the sync

# A convient way to overlay it is to add a `.env` file with the contents:
#  COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose-unison.yml
# You can also do it manually when you run docker-compose each time with
# docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-unison.yml
# if you are making changes to docker-compose.yml or this file it is useful to
# run `docker-compose config` which shows how the two files get merged together
