      # It can be confusing that we provide this kind of ID as 'user_id' param. However Labbook service simply merges

      # Labbook is opened, `update_at` timestamp is updated and the album link is sent to Portal. So, if `created_at`
      # and `updated_at` are equal, it means that Labbook has never been opened and there can't be any content yet.
