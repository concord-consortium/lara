#
# This is a docker-compose overlay that connects LARA to the portal via a 
# proxy container. It assumes the proxy container name is "http-proxy"  
#
# - If you are running dinghy on Mac OS, this is the name the dinghy proxy 
#   will have if you followed its documentation here:
#   https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy-http-proxy#os-x
#
# - If you are running dory on linux, you will need to change the default
#   name of the http proxy container. To do that you will need to tell
#   dory to generate a config file. Do that with
#       `dory config-file`
#   This will write the config file ~/.dory.yml
#   Change the following config file line in the "nginx_proxy" section from:
#       container_name: dory_dinghy_http_proxy
#   to:
#       container_name: http-proxy
#
# NOTE if your proxy is not configured correctly, oauth will fail to
# authenticate users against portal. 
#
# You will also need to set the PORTAL_HOST environment variable to match 
# the name of the portal host. If you are using the dinghy or dory proxy
# this will be:
#   app.[project name of portal].docker
#   examples: app.portal.docker, app.rigse.docker
#
# To setup the client id and client secret you should run this command in 
# the portal project:
#   docker-compose run --rm app rake sso:add_client
# When asked for "secret" you can use 'unsecure local secret' so you don't 
# need to change this file.
