# In this file the web app port is not published. However, if you run
# `docker-compose up` (without customizing your environment) the port will be published
# to 3000.  This is because the docker-compose.override.yml file will be loaded
# automatically by docker-compose.
# You will likely want to modify how the port is published, so it doesn't conflict.
# Take a look at the this overlay for more information:
#   docker/dev/docker-compose-random-port.yml
